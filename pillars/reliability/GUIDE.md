## Overview

The AWS Well-Architected Framework Reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to. This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle, covering availability, fault tolerance, disaster recovery, and change management.

Note: The Well-Architected Framework is designed to help AWS customers understand and optimize their workloads. Here are a few contexts where a Well Architected review for the Reliability pillar makes sense to do:

1. Planning the launch of a new workload.
2. Preparing for a periodic disaster recovery test.
3. Before and after a change in your deployment methodology, such as a move from instance-based to containerized workload deployment or migration to a fully orchestrated, CI/CD, or infrastructure-as-code deployment model.
4. When your budget or funding changes or is expected to change.
5. Periodically to evaluate opportunities to optimize your Reliability strategy as you optimize your worloads, and as new services and features become available in AWS.

### Key Benefits of Reliability Reviews

- **Improved Availability**: Identify and address single points of failure
- **Enhanced Fault Tolerance**: Build resilient systems that gracefully handle failures
- **Better Recovery**: Implement effective disaster recovery and backup strategies
- **Reduced Downtime**: Minimize business impact from system failures
- **Operational Excellence**: Establish robust change management and monitoring practices

### Review Scope

This guide covers the four key areas of the Reliability pillar:
- **Foundations**: Service quotas, network topology, and foundational requirements
- **Workload Architecture**: Service design, distributed system interactions, and failure handling
- **Change Management**: Deployment practices, rollback procedures, and monitoring
- **Failure Management**: Backup strategies, disaster recovery, and testing procedures

**Important Note**: Reliability is not just about technology—it requires organizational processes, testing procedures, and operational practices to be truly effective.

## Understanding the Reliability Pillar

### Reliability Definition

**Reliability** encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to. This includes:

- **Availability**: The percentage of time a workload is available for use
- **Fault Tolerance**: The ability to continue operating despite component failures
- **Disaster Recovery**: The ability to recover from significant failures or disasters
- **Change Management**: The ability to deploy changes safely without impacting reliability

### Core Concepts

#### Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
The average time between system failures, used to measure system reliability:
```
MTBF = Total Operating Time / Number of Failures
```

#### Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
The average time required to restore service after a failure:
```
MTTR = Total Downtime / Number of Incidents
```

#### Availability Calculation
The percentage of time a system is operational:
```
Availability = (Total Time - Downtime) / Total Time × 100%
```

#### Recovery Objectives
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable downtime
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss

### Reliability vs. Other Pillars

#### Relationship with Security
- Security incidents can impact availability
- Security controls must not compromise system reliability
- Incident response procedures must address both security and reliability

#### Relationship with Performance
- Performance degradation can affect perceived availability
- Load balancing and auto-scaling improve both performance and reliability
- Monitoring must cover both performance and reliability metrics

#### Relationship with Cost Optimization
- Higher availability typically increases costs
- Trade-offs between cost and reliability must be carefully considered
- Reserved capacity and multi-region deployments impact both cost and reliability

## Availability Fundamentals

### Availability Tiers and Business Impact

| Availability | Downtime/Year | Downtime/Month | Downtime/Week | Application Examples |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **90%** | 36.5 days | 3 days | 16.8 hours | Development/test environments |
| **95%** | 18.25 days | 1.5 days | 8.4 hours | Internal tools, batch processing |
| **99%** | 3.65 days | 7.2 hours | 1.68 hours | Non-critical business applications |
| **99.9%** | 8.76 hours | 43.2 minutes | 10.1 minutes | Standard business applications |
| **99.95%** | 4.38 hours | 21.6 minutes | 5.04 minutes | E-commerce, customer-facing apps |
| **99.99%** | 52.56 minutes | 4.32 minutes | 1.01 minutes | Critical business systems |
| **99.999%** | 5.26 minutes | 25.9 seconds | 6.05 seconds | Financial systems, emergency services |

### Calculating System Availability

#### Series Dependencies (Hard Dependencies)
When systems have hard dependencies, availability is multiplicative:
```
System Availability = Component A × Component B × Component C
Example: 99.9% × 99.9% × 99.9% = 99.7%
```

#### Parallel Redundancy (Independent Components)
With redundant components, availability improves significantly:
```
System Availability = 1 - (1 - Component A) × (1 - Component B)
Example: 1 - (1 - 0.999) × (1 - 0.999) = 99.9999%
```

#### Mixed Architectures
Real systems often combine series and parallel components:
```
Load Balancer (99.99%) → [Web Server A (99.9%) OR Web Server B (99.9%)] → Database (99.95%)
= 99.99% × 99.9999% × 99.95% = 99.9399%
```

### Availability Patterns and Anti-Patterns

#### High Availability Patterns
1. **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Deploy across multiple Availability Zones
2. **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjust capacity based on demand
3. **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple instances
4. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures
5. **Bulkhead**: Isolate critical resources
6. **Retry with Backoff**: Handle transient failures gracefully

#### Common Anti-Patterns
1. **Single Points of Failure**: Critical components without redundancy
2. **Tight Coupling**: Services that fail together
3. **Synchronous Dependencies**: Blocking calls that can cascade failures
4. **Insufficient Monitoring**: Lack of visibility into system health
5. **Manual Recovery**: Relying on human intervention for recovery
6. **Untested Procedures**: Disaster recovery plans that haven't been validated
