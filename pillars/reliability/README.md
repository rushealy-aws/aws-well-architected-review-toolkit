# Reliability Pillar - AWS Well-Architected Review

The Reliability pillar encompasses the ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected to.

## 🔄 Overview

Reliability focuses on the ability to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.

### Key Benefits

- **High Availability**: Minimize downtime and service interruptions
- **Fault Tolerance**: Gracefully handle component failures
- **Disaster Recovery**: Rapid recovery from major incidents
- **Scalability**: Handle varying loads effectively
- **Predictable Performance**: Consistent service delivery

## 🏗️ Reliability Design Principles

1. **Automatically recover from failure**
2. **Test recovery procedures**
3. **Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability**
4. **Stop guessing capacity**
5. **Manage change in automation**

## 📋 Reliability Areas Covered

### 1. Foundations
- Service quotas and constraints
- Network topology planning
- Service limits management

### 2. Workload Architecture
- Service-oriented architecture
- Distributed system design
- Microservices patterns

### 3. Change Management
- Deployment strategies
- Automated change management
- Rollback procedures

### 4. Failure Management
- Failure isolation
- Recovery procedures
- Monitoring and alerting

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- AWS account with deployed workloads
- Understanding of current architecture
- Access to monitoring and logging data
- Stakeholder availability (SRE, operations teams)

### Getting Started

1. **Run the reliability assessment script:**
   ```bash
   cd pillars/reliability
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ./scripts/reliability-assessment.sh
   ```

2. **Review the comprehensive guide:**
   ```bash
   # Open the detailed reliability review guide
   cat GUIDE.md
   ```

3. **Follow the step-by-step process:**
   - Analyze current architecture
   - Review failure scenarios
   - Test recovery procedures
   - Document improvement recommendations

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Runtime |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `reliability-assessment.sh` | Comprehensive reliability analysis | 20-45 min |

## 📊 Key Reliability Metrics

- **Availability**: System uptime percentage (99.9%, 99.99%, etc.)
- **MTTR**: Mean Time To Recovery
- **MTBF**: Mean Time Between Failures
- **RPO**: Recovery Point Objective
- **RTO**: Recovery Time Objective
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests

## 🎯 Common Reliability Improvements

### Quick Wins (< 1 week)
- Enable Multi-AZ deployments
- Configure health checks
- Set up basic monitoring and alerting
- Review and test backup procedures
- Implement auto-scaling policies

### Short Term (1-4 weeks)
- Implement circuit breaker patterns
- Set up cross-region replication
- Configure automated failover
- Enhance monitoring dashboards
- Create runbooks for common failures

### Medium Term (1-3 months)
- Implement chaos engineering practices
- Design for graceful degradation
- Implement advanced load balancing
- Set up comprehensive disaster recovery
- Automate recovery procedures

## 📈 Availability Targets

| Service Level | Downtime per Year | Downtime per Month | Use Case |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 99% | 3.65 days | 7.31 hours | Development/Testing |
| 99.9% | 8.77 hours | 43.83 minutes | Standard Production |
| 99.95% | 4.38 hours | 21.92 minutes | High Availability |
| 99.99% | 52.60 minutes | 4.38 minutes | Mission Critical |
| 99.999% | 5.26 minutes | 26.30 seconds | Ultra High Availability |
