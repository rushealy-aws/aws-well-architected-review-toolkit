## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone or Download the Toolkit

```bash
# If you have the toolkit as a Git repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/aws-well-architected-review-toolkit.git
cd aws-well-architected-review-toolkit

# Or if you downloaded it as a ZIP file
unzip aws-well-architected-review-toolkit.zip
cd aws-well-architected-review-toolkit
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script

```bash
# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x shared/scripts/setup-environment.sh

# Run the setup script
./shared/scripts/setup-environment.sh
```

The setup script will:
- Verify AWS CLI installation and configuration
- Check your AWS permissions
- Create necessary local directories
- Set up environment variables

### 3. Verify Your Setup

After running the setup script, you should see:
- ✅ AWS CLI is installed
- ✅ AWS CLI is configured
- ✅ Well-Architected Tool access confirmed
- ✅ Other service access confirmations

## Your First Review

### Step 1: Choose a Pillar

Start with the pillar that aligns with your immediate priorities:

- **Cost Optimization**: If you want to reduce AWS costs
- **Security**: If you have security concerns or compliance requirements
- **Reliability**: If you're experiencing availability issues
- **Performance Efficiency**: If you have performance concerns
- **Operational Excellence**: If you want to improve operations
- **Sustainability**: If you want to reduce environmental impact

### Step 2: Navigate to the Pillar Directory

```bash
# Example: Starting with Cost Optimization
cd pillars/cost-optimization
```

### Step 3: Read the Pillar Guide

```bash
# Open the comprehensive guide
cat GUIDE.md
# Or use your preferred text editor/viewer
```

### Step 4: Run the Assessment Script

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run the baseline assessment
./scripts/cost-baseline-assessment.sh
```

### Step 5: Follow the Step-by-Step Guide

Open the `GUIDE.md` file and follow the detailed instructions for conducting your review.

### Each Pillar Directory Contains:

- **README.md**: Pillar overview and quick start
- **GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive step-by-step review guide
- **scripts/**: Automation scripts for assessment and testing
- **templates/**: Configuration templates and checklists (if applicable)

## Choosing Your First Pillar

### Decision Matrix

| Pillar | Choose If You Want To... | Time Investment | Immediate Impact |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Cost Optimization** | Reduce AWS spending | Medium | High |
| **Security** | Improve security posture | High | Critical |
| **Reliability** | Increase system availability | High | High |
| **Performance Efficiency** | Optimize performance | Medium | Medium |
| **Operational Excellence** | Improve operations | High | Medium |
| **Sustainability** | Reduce environmental impact | Low | Low |

### Recommended Starting Order

1. **Security** - Foundation for everything else
2. **Cost Optimization** - Quick wins and immediate value
3. **Reliability** - Ensure system stability
4. **Performance Efficiency** - Optimize resource usage
5. **Operational Excellence** - Improve processes
6. **Sustainability** - Long-term environmental goals

## Running Assessments

### Pre-Assessment Checklist

Before running any assessment scripts:

- [ ] AWS CLI is configured with correct account/region
- [ ] You have necessary IAM permissions
- [ ] You understand your current architecture
- [ ] You have identified the workload to review
- [ ] You have allocated sufficient time for the review

### Assessment Script Types

Each pillar typically includes these types of scripts:

1. **Baseline Assessment**: Analyzes current state
2. **Configuration Audit**: Checks configurations against best practices
3. **Performance Testing**: Validates performance characteristics
4. **Compliance Check**: Verifies compliance with standards

### Running Scripts Safely

```bash
# Always make scripts executable first
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Review the script before running
cat scripts/script-name.sh

# Run with verbose output for troubleshooting
bash -x scripts/script-name.sh

# Redirect output to a file for later analysis
./scripts/script-name.sh > assessment-results.txt 2>&1
```

## Interpreting Results

### Understanding Output Files

Assessment scripts typically generate:
- **Text reports**: Human-readable summaries
- **JSON files**: Machine-readable data for further processing
- **CSV files**: Data for spreadsheet analysis
- **Log files**: Detailed execution logs

### Common Output Locations

- `outputs/`: Assessment results and reports
- `reports/`: Formatted reports and summaries
- `logs/`: Execution logs and debug information

### Key Metrics to Focus On

Each pillar has specific metrics:
- **Cost**: Spend trends, optimization opportunities, waste identification
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, access issues
- **Reliability**: Availability metrics, failure points, recovery capabilities
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput, resource utilization
- **Operations**: Automation levels, monitoring coverage, incident response
- **Sustainability**: Resource efficiency, carbon footprint, optimization opportunities

## Next Steps

### After Your First Assessment

1. **Review Results**: Carefully analyze the assessment output
2. **Prioritize Issues**: Focus on high-impact, low-effort improvements first
3. **Create Action Plan**: Develop a roadmap for implementing improvements
4. **Implement Changes**: Start with quick wins and critical security issues
5. **Re-assess**: Run assessments again to measure improvement
6. **Expand Scope**: Move to additional pillars or workloads

### Building a Review Practice

1. **Schedule Regular Reviews**: Quarterly or bi-annual reviews
2. **Train Your Team**: Share knowledge and best practices
3. **Automate Where Possible**: Use scripts and tools for efficiency
4. **Document Learnings**: Keep track of what works and what doesn't
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update your processes
