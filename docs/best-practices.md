## Review Planning Best Practices

### Pre-Review Preparation

**Define Clear Objectives**
- Establish specific, measurable goals for each review
- Align review objectives with business priorities
- Set realistic timelines and resource allocations
- Document success criteria upfront

**Workload Selection Strategy**
- Start with critical business workloads
- Consider workloads with known issues or concerns
- Balance between high-impact and quick-win opportunities
- Prioritize workloads with upcoming changes or migrations

**Resource Planning**
- Allocate 2-4 weeks for comprehensive pillar reviews
- Plan for 20-40 hours of effort per pillar depending on complexity
- Include time for stakeholder interviews and documentation review
- Schedule follow-up sessions for implementation planning

### Review Scope Definition

**Workload Boundaries**
```
Clear Scope Definition:
✅ Specific application or service
✅ Defined infrastructure components
✅ Clear data flows and dependencies
✅ Identified stakeholders and owners

Avoid Scope Creep:
❌ "Everything in our AWS account"
❌ Multiple unrelated applications
❌ Undefined or changing requirements
❌ Lack of clear ownership
```

**Multi-Pillar Coordination**
- Conduct security reviews first (foundational)
- Coordinate cost and performance reviews (often related)
- Align operational excellence with all other pillars
- Plan sustainability reviews after optimization efforts

## Prioritization Strategies

### Risk-Based Prioritization

**Risk Assessment Matrix**
```
Impact vs. Probability Matrix:

High Impact, High Probability    → Critical (Fix Immediately)
High Impact, Low Probability     → Important (Plan and Prepare)
Low Impact, High Probability     → Monitor (Quick Fixes)
Low Impact, Low Probability      → Accept (Document Only)
```

**Business Impact Scoring**
- **Revenue Impact**: Direct effect on revenue generation
- **Customer Impact**: Effect on customer experience
- **Operational Impact**: Effect on team productivity
- **Compliance Impact**: Regulatory or policy implications
- **Security Impact**: Potential security risks

### Implementation Effort Assessment

## Advanced Techniques

### Automation Integration

**Infrastructure as Code Integration**
```yaml
# Example: Terraform validation
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # Well-Architected compliance checks
  monitoring                  = true
  ebs_optimized              = true
  disable_api_termination    = true
  
  # Cost optimization
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  
  # Security
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web.id]
  
  tags = {
    Name        = "web-server"
    Environment = var.environment
    Owner       = var.owner
    CostCenter  = var.cost_center
  }
}
```

**Policy as Code**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Custom Assessment Tools

**Automated Compliance Checking**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Custom compliance checker

check_encryption() {
    echo "Checking S3 bucket encryption..."
    aws s3api list-buckets --query 'Buckets[].Name' --output text | \
    while read bucket; do
        encryption=$(aws s3api get-bucket-encryption --bucket "$bucket" 2>/dev/null)
        if [ -z "$encryption" ]; then
            echo "❌ Bucket $bucket: No encryption configured"
        else
            echo "✅ Bucket $bucket: Encryption configured"
        fi
    done
}
```

### Multi-Account Strategies

**Cross-Account Assessment**
```bash
# Assume role in target account
aws sts assume-role \
    --role-arn "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT-ID:role/WellArchitectedReviewRole" \
    --role-session-name "WellArchitectedReview" \
    --query 'Credentials.[AccessKeyId,SecretAccessKey,SessionToken]' \
    --output text
```
