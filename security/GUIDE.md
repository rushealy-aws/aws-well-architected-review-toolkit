## Overview

The AWS Well-Architected Framework Security pillar encompasses the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security. This guide provides a comprehensive approach to conducting security reviews using the AWS Well-Architected Tool, helping you identify security gaps and implement best practices.

### Key Benefits of Security Reviews

- **Risk Reduction**: Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited
- **Compliance Alignment**: Ensure adherence to regulatory requirements and industry standards
- **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls
- **Incident Preparedness**: Establish robust incident response and recovery procedures
- **Continuous Improvement**: Build a culture of security awareness and ongoing enhancement

### Review Scope

This guide covers the seven key areas of the Security pillar:
- **Security Foundations**: Organizational security requirements and governance
- **Identity and Access Management**: Authentication, authorization, and privilege management

- **Data Protection**: Encryption, classification, and data lifecycle management
- **Incident Response**: Preparation, detection, analysis, and recovery procedures
- **Application Security**: Secure development practices and application-level controls

**Important Note**: Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and customers. This guide focuses on customer responsibilities while leveraging AWS security services and capabilities.

## Understanding the Security Pillar

### Security Definition

**Security** encompasses the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security. This includes:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals
- **Integrity**: Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data and systems
- **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users and systems
- **Authorization**: Controlling access to resources based on verified identity
- **Non-repudiation**: Ensuring actions cannot be denied by the actor

### Shared Responsibility Model

#### AWS Responsibilities (Security OF the Cloud)
- Physical security of data centers
- Hardware and software infrastructure
- Network infrastructure and virtualization
- Managed service security configurations
- Global infrastructure security

#### Customer Responsibilities (Security IN the Cloud)
- Operating system and network configuration
- Platform and application management
- Identity and access management
- Data encryption and protection
- Network traffic protection
- Security group and firewall configuration

### Security vs. Other Pillars

#### Security and Reliability
- Security incidents can impact system availability
- Security controls must not compromise system reliability
- Incident response procedures must maintain business continuity

#### Security and Performance
- Security controls may impact system performance
- Encryption and monitoring add computational overhead
- Balance security requirements with performance needs

#### Security and Cost
- Security investments require cost-benefit analysis
- Automated security controls reduce operational costs
- Security incidents can have significant financial impact

## Security Design Principles

### 1. Implement a Strong Identity Foundation

**Principle**: Implement the principle of least privilege and enforce separation of duties with appropriate authorization for each interaction with AWS resources.

**Implementation Strategies:**
- **Centralized Identity Management**: Use AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly SSO) or external identity providers
- **Least Privilege Access**: Grant minimum permissions necessary for job functions
- **Separation of Duties**: Distribute critical functions across multiple individuals
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Periodically review and validate access permissions

**AWS Services:**
- AWS IAM for access management
- AWS IAM Identity Center for centralized identity
- AWS Organizations for multi-account governance
- AWS CloudTrail for access auditing

### 2. Maintain Traceability

**Principle**: Monitor, alert, and audit actions and changes to your environment in real time.

**Implementation Strategies:**
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Enable logging across all AWS services and applications
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement automated monitoring and alerting
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain detailed records of all system and user activities
- **Automated Response**: Use automation to respond to security events

**AWS Services:**
- AWS CloudTrail for API logging
- Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting
- AWS Config for configuration change tracking
- AWS Security Hub for centralized security findings

### 3. Apply Security at All Layers

**Principle**: Apply a defense in depth approach with multiple security controls at all layers.

**Implementation Strategies:**
- **Network Security**: Implement VPCs, security groups, and NACLs
- **Host Security**: Secure operating systems and applications
- **Application Security**: Implement secure coding practices
- **Data Security**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit

**AWS Services:**
- Amazon VPC for network isolation
- AWS WAF for application protection
- AWS Shield for DDoS protection
- AWS KMS for encryption key management

### 4. Automate Security Best Practices

**Principle**: Use automated software-based security mechanisms to improve scalability and cost-effectiveness.

**Implementation Strategies:**
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Define security controls in code templates
- **Automated Compliance**: Use services to automatically check compliance

### 6. Keep People Away from Data

**Principle**: Reduce or eliminate direct access to data to minimize human error and mishandling.

- **API-based Access**: Provide programmatic access instead of direct data access
- **Role-based Access**: Use service roles instead of user credentials
- **Data Masking**: Implement data masking for non-production environments
