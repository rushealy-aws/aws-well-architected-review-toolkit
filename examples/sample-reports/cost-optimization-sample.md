## Executive Summary

### Overall Assessment
- **Current Maturity Level:** Level 2 - Managed
- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Priority Recommendations:** 8 high-priority items identified
- **Estimated Implementation Effort:** 12-16 weeks

### Key Findings
The e-commerce platform shows good foundational cost management practices but has significant opportunities for optimization. Current monthly spend of $45,000 could be reduced by 25-30% through right-sizing, reserved capacity, and architectural improvements. The workload lacks automated cost monitoring and optimization, presenting both risk and opportunity.

#### Areas for Improvement
- No Reserved Instance or Savings Plans usage
- Over-provisioned database instances
- Inefficient storage types and configurations
- Lack of automated cost optimization

#### Critical Issues
- 40% of EC2 instances consistently under-utilized
- Database running on oversized instances
- No cost allocation tags for proper attribution
- Missing cost anomaly detection

## Detailed Findings

### High Risk Issues

#### Issue #1: Underutilized EC2 Instances
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Impact:** $8,000/month in wasted compute costs
- **Current State:** 15 instances averaging 25% CPU utilization
- **Recommendation:** Right-size to smaller instance types and implement Reserved Instances
- **Implementation Effort:** 2-3 weeks
- **Timeline:** Immediate priority

#### Issue #2: Oversized RDS Instances
- **Risk Level:** High
- **Impact:** $3,500/month in unnecessary database costs
- **Current State:** db.r5.2xlarge instances with 40% utilization
- **Recommendation:** Downsize to db.r5.xlarge and implement read replicas
- **Implementation Effort:** 1-2 weeks
- **Timeline:** Within 30 days

### Medium Risk Issues

#### Issue #3: Inefficient Storage Configuration
- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Impact:** $1,200/month in storage optimization opportunities
- **Current State:** All EBS volumes using gp2, no S3 Intelligent Tiering
- **Recommendation:** Migrate to gp3 volumes and implement S3 Intelligent Tiering
- **Implementation Effort:** 3-4 weeks
- **Timeline:** 60-90 days

### Low Risk Issues

#### Issue #4: Missing Cost Allocation Tags
- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Impact:** Inability to track costs by business unit
- **Current State:** 60% of resources lack proper cost allocation tags
- **Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive tagging strategy
- **Implementation Effort:** 2-3 weeks
- **Timeline:** 90 days
